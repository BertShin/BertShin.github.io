## Kobe - A Homage for my best buddy... my doge

### Overview

Meet Kobe.

Kobe is a 3D animated and interactive graphic that will be named and modeled after my dog. This application will be completed within a 5-day deadline and will feature Vanilla JavaScript. Kobe is a Mini white american eskimo.

  * This application will be interactive in a sense that the user will be able to pet Kobe, feed him his favorite treat (A piece of juicy watermelon), and use a toy to play with him.

    * I will begin by trying to render his face and his mane and If I far enough, next will be his body!
    * For the interactive elements, I will start with the petting, second; the treat, and lastly the toy.


### Interactivity and Functionality

When visiting Kobe, users will be able to:

  * Visit Kobe and say Hi :) (landing page, various facial expressions)
  * Pet Kobe and watch as he enjoys being pet.
  * Feed Kobe a piece of his favorite treat.
  * Wave a toy and play with Kobe.

Other features of this application will include:

  * Links to my Github, LinkedIn, AngelList, and a Flickr account that contains pictures of my doge. (jk) (actually maybe)
  * Directions on how to interact with Kobe.
  * Background music.
  * Information about how this graphic is being rendered.


### Technologies

This application will focus on and mainly utilize Vanilla `JavaScript` and feature the capabilities of the technology. In addition:

  * `three.js` for 3D Graphics.
  * `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation/Rendering.
  * `Webpack` for bundling.
